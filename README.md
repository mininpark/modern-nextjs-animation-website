<h2>NextJS project to learn how to implement GSAP and review a previous project</h2>

<h3>WHAT I LEARNED:</h3>


- Fundamental react project architecture and folder structure

- Next13 application structure

- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex using Tailwind CSS
  - No BEM & Kinda ugly class names (complicated to use :before, :after), that makes harder to find Components in Dev Tools
  - Tailwind and Class Name Props donâ€™t mix well

- Implement GSAP Animation: From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
  - Need to improve: Re-implement same GSAP Animation into different Ref, Components
  
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost all devices using Tailwind CSS
